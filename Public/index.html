               Hello, my name is Abir Jmail and here's a small bio about me...

               I was born and raised in the city of Tozeur down south, then moved to the capital Tunis where I joined the Faculty of Matematics & Physics for 4 years, and graduated with honours as a Math teacher.
               
               I have recently discovered my passion for coding, and so I decided to persue a career change as a Full Stack developer, by attending 'GO MY CODE' School.
